The pycddlib package provides Python bindings for
`cddlib <https://people.inf.ethz.ch/fukudak/cdd_home/>`_,
which is a C implementation of the double description method
for generating all extreme points of a general convex polyhedron
given by a system of linear inequalities.
The library also supports the reverse operation
(i.e. convex hull computation).
This means that one can move back and forth between an
inequality representation and an extreme point
representation of a polyhedron.

The library can also solve a variety of other problems related to linear algebra.
This includes linear programming,
Fourier elimination,
computing ranks,
computing adjacencies and incidences,
and removing redundancies from systems of linear inequalities.
